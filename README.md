# Process for merging 
1. Create a new branch for the feature that you will implement, make sure to give the branch a descriptive name
2. Push the branch to the repository
3. Create a pull request to merge it to the main branch

## Put descriptive notes in your commits and pull requests so that your groupmates will know what you implemented and changed

### Merge your feature branch to main once in a while to stay updated to the main branch
### We will use pull requests in order to avoid the main branch becoming messy
